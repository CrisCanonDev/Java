### [Fibonnaci Serie](fibonnaciSerie.java)
Method that returns a String containing a series of Fibonacci numbers. The method takes one parameter: an integer of how many numbers (series length) to include.

### [Nested Loops](NestedLoops.java)
Method called NestedLoop, which takes one String variable **s** and an integer variable **upper_limit** as its parameters. In the method, construct a nested loop structure, where the outer loop iterates the letters of the given String **s**. The inner loop iterates from 0 until **upper limit** (including the upper limit).

### [Quadrant of a coordenate](QuadrantOfCoordenates.java)
Method to determine the quadrant of a point (x,y) in a coordinate plane. The rules for figuring out the quadrant are as follows:
    • If both x and y are positive, the point belongs to quadrant 1.
    • If y is positive and x is negative, the point belongs to quadrant 2.
    • If both x and y are negative, the point belongs to quadrant 3.
    • If x is positive and y is negative, the point belongs to quadrant 4.
    • The origin (0,0) does not belong to any quadrant (quadrant 0).
    • If either x is 0 or y is 0, it means that the point is in between of quadrants (quadrant 0).

### [Sum of numbers](SumOfNumbers.java)
Java program that asks the user to enter a series of natural numbers (positive integers), calculate their sum, and print the sum out for the user. When the user enters a negative integer number or zero, the program stops and prints the sum.

### [Sum of numbers](YearsMonthsDays.java)
Java method that calculates how many years, weeks and days can be formed from a given integer variable days. The method should take one integer variable as its parameter, and it should return a String variable.
